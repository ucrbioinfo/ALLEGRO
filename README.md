# Introduction
ALLEGRO (_<ins>Al</ins>gorithm for a <ins>L</ins>inear program <ins>E</ins>nabling <ins>G</ins>uide <ins>R</ins>NA <ins>O</ins>ptimization_) is a synthetic biology tool leveraging Google OR-Tools integer linear programming to design the smallest possible gRNA library to fulfill user-specified constraints.

- Design a Cas9 gRNA library for thousands of species simultaneously
- Flexible library design using an ensemble of options such as tracks, multiplicity, pre- and post-clustering, guide cutting efficacy prediction, and more
- Extremely fast and computationally efficient
- Written in Python, Cython, and C++
